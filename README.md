# Coding Challenge

The scope of this challenge is to create an API application. We are mainly interested in code style and structure.

## Specifications
* Use data from this dataset for your application: ​[Link](http://opendata-esri-de.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/273bf4ae7f6a460fbf3000d73f7b2f76_0
)
* Build a data importer that brings the data into your application
* Build an endpoint that delivers the number of buildings per zip code
* Build an endpoint that shows the distribution of years in which buildings were added to the dataset (​STR_DATUM​)
* Make both endpoints filterable by zip codes
